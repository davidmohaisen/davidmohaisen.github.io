My name is David Mohaisen[^1], and I am a [Full Professor](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/person/aziz-mohaisen/) of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/) at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) with joint appointments in [Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucf.edu/) and [Modeling and Simulation](https://www.ucf.edu/modeling-simulation/). My [research work](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/70/2832.html) is in the area of security and privacy, and I have been recently focusing on topics such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, software and networked systems, internet of things and wearables, and blockchains. My active work pursuits include:

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), in 2012, where I was a [fellow](https://cla.umn.edu/graduate-students/research-creative-inquiry/doctoral-dissertation-fellowship-ddf) advised by [Prof. Yongdae Kim](https://syssec.kaist.ac.kr/~yongdaek/). I spent several years before and after then in the research and development industry, working as a research engineer at [ETRI](https://etri.re.kr/intro.html) and as a (senior) research scientist at Verisign Labs. At UCF, I direct the Security and Analytics Lab (SEAL), where I have been fortunate to mentor, work with, and learn from several hardworking graduate and undergraduate students.
